You irrevocably grant a PERPETUAL, ROYALTY FREE, EXCLUSIVE, UNIVERSE-WIDE license in and to all rights in

retained by You pursuant to Paragraph 6 above. Each such license irrevocably grants Collab Clips (for any and all uses
at all) the sole and exclusive universe-wide right, title and interest, in and to the Content on a fully-paid, royalty-free,
licensable and transferable (in whole or part) basis, including, without limitation, in and to the Content and all elements,
including to exhibit, comment on, modify, create derivative works in Collab Clips’s sole and unfettered discretion, in, on,
and via all methods, and means, now known or hereafter devised or invented for any and all purposes, without further
notice to You without the expectation or requirement of any (additional) permission from or payment to You (except as
expressly provided by Paragraph 12 below) or to any other person or entity. Except as expressly permitted by Paragraph
6 above, You may not and will not make, license, or allow any use of any portion of the Content.If required, You will
execute additional documents to give effect to the license grant to, and vesting of such license in, Collab Clips of the
Content and all other rights therein or in connection therewith. If Collab Clips is unable, for any reason, to secure Your
signature to memorialize the grant, transfer, or assignment of any rights in and to any Content or rights granted under this
Agreement, You hereby irrevocably designate and appoint Collab Clips and Collab Clips’s duly authorized officers and
agents as Your agents and attorneys-in-fact to act for and on Your behalf and instead of You to take all lawfully
permitted acts in furtherance thereto and to enforce its rights under and to such Content and all other rights, all with the
same legal force and effect as if executed by You. The foregoing is deemed a power coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable. As a part of the exercise of rights granted to Collab Clips under this Agreement, You also give Us the right to
use Your real and professional name, screen name, or nom de guere, voice, likeness (picture or video), biographical
information, appearance and performance in and in connection with the Content (collectively, the “Personal Rights”). If
you have applied for or received a copyright registration in connection with the Content or any portion of the Content
You will immediately notify us of that.
Your exclusive assignment, transfer, grant of license of rights to Collab Clips of the Content, and this Agreement are
supported by reasonable and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which is or are hereby acknowledged
by You. You acknowledge that such consideration includes the mere possibility of Compiler’s or Collab Clips’ (as
defined, and naturally its other licensees) use or display and/or distribution of the Content, and the mere possibility of the
publicity and promotion by Compiler or from Collab Clips’ use or display and/or distribution of the Content, and the mere
possible use of Your Personality Rights.
You (and Your heirs) waive any Moral Right. You hereby give a Moral Rights Consent or Waiver. which is a waiver of socalled moral rights to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and an unconditional consent to any act or
omission in relation to the Content by or on behalf of Collab Clips, Compiler, or any other licensee or subsequent owner
of copyright in the Content, including an act or omission which might or would, but for this Agreement, violate or infringe
Moral Rights.
While a third party which We refer to as “Compiler” is involved in the Agreement in that Compiler and Collab Clips have
entered into an agreement whereby Compiler has agreed, under certain circumstances to help promote certain content
You are entering into this Agreement with Collab Clips and the entity that controls it, and its successors, subsidiaries,
affiliates, or assignees (collectively, " Collab Clips ", "we", "us", "our ", whether in bold, UPPERCASE, lowercase, or
a COMBination); and in certain instances it’s or their licensees or licensors may also have or be granted rights by Collab
Clips so as to effectuate some or all of the purposes and intent of this Agreement. Compiler is, at the option of Collab
Clips, deemed to be a Collab Clips licensee, without Our having to repeat that multiple times throughout this Agreement.
Compiler is not a direct party to this Agreement and you waive any and all rights or claims to assert that You are a third
party beneficiary to any agreement between Compiler and Collab Clips, and you waive any and all rights and claims
against, and release any and all claims, and as pertains to Compiler.
We and our licensees (including, of course, Compiler) don’t have to use or promote the Content, the Personality Rights,
or any of the rights you grant us.
Provided that You are not in breach or default of this Agreement, and subject to the other terms of the Agreement, in the
event We directly license any of Your Content for an unaffiliated third party commercial paid exploitation (e.g., use in a
television program or television commercial or other non-promotional paid opportunity) (a “Third Party Commercial Use”),
You shall be entitled to an amount equal to Thirty-three Percent (33%) of One Hundred Percent (100%) of Gross
Revenue. Subject to the terms hereof, “Gross Revenue” means all amounts actually received and retained by Collab
Clips directly resulting from Collab Clips licensing rights in Your Content to an unaffiliated third party (e.g., not in any way
exploited or distributed in, on or across Collab’s promotional network or any of Collab’s owned or operated platforms,
channels, websites or social media accounts, including the Site) for a Third Party Commercial Use.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, You shall not be entitled to any share of Gross Revenue or other compensation in
connection with (i) Your Content as part of Collab’s sale, divesting or licensing of all or a material portion of its content
library, content catalog, assets, and/or equity to a third party as part of a change of control, acquisition or otherwise, or
(ii) Your Content as part of a so-called “compilation” (i.e., where Your Content is combined with one or more pieces of
content from either us or a third party to form a whole new piece of content). Subject to the foregoing, in the event
Collab Clips licenses Your Content as stand-alone content together with other stand-alone content created by a third
party (i.e., not as part of a so-called “compilation”, but as a so-called “bulk license”) in one transaction or agreement,
Collab Clips shall in good faith allocate its revenue from such license separately to each item of content (jncluding Your
Content) based on the number of items, length of each item, view count / popularity of each item, usage length of each
item, etc. and shall determine Your share of Gross Revenue accordingly based on such allocation. For the avoidance of
doubt, You shall not be entitled to a share of Gross Revenue where Your Content is sold, divested or licensed by or on
behalf of Collab as part of all or a material portion of Collab’s content library and/or catalog. To the extent that You are
entitled a a share of Gross Revenue hereunder, We shall inform you of such entitlement with reliance upon the contact
information provided by You to us at time of submission. If You fail to provide Your payment information (i.e., bank
account details) within sixty (60) days of our request, or We are unable to contact you (using the contact information
provided by You), You shall forfeit Your Share of Gross Revenue hereunder, without any liability of any nature whatsoever
on our part to You. For the avoidance of doubt, You acknowledge and agree that neither Collab nor any of it’s
assignees, designees and/or licensees guarantees or promises that any Gross Revenue shall be generated from Your
Content, and that We shall have no obligation of any nature whatsoever to use and/or otherwise exploit Your Content.
In order to have submitted Content to us You used Our Site. In doing so You agreed to the Terms of the Site
(https://collab-uncle.herokuapp.com/terms). The following sections and sub-sections of the Terms of the Site are hereby
integrated by reference as though they were set forth in full herein, and You again agree to them as part of this

where in the Terms of the Site a sentence might read something such as “in connection with your accessing or using the
Site,” such sentences are amended and deemed to state in this Agreement something more along the lines of “in
connection with the Agreement, the Content, or Your accessing or using any Site,” and the word “Agreement” is

acknowledge and understand that Section 1542 of the California Civil Code reads as follows: “A GENERAL
